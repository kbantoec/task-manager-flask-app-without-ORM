# Task Manager App without ORM

Task Manager App without the `SQLAlchemy` ORM.

This is the same project as posted in my [task-manager-flask-app repo](https://github.com/kbantoec/task-manager-flask-app). However, this project involves bypassing the SQLAlchemy ORM whilst interacting with the database utilizing the `sqlite3` module.

This project involves basic knowledge of the SQL language, the Flask micro-framework, Python, and basic HTML and CSS.

Moreover, you should not be tracking the `config.py` file with the version controller.
